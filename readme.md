# Stream Sort
Computers are scary.

Sorting algorithms, such as bubble sort and quick sort rely on fancy equations done by computers.

What if we didn't need to rely on scary computers to sort numbers? This is where Stream Sort comes in.

NOBODY'S TALKING TO YOU

Escape the matrix, and trust the most reliable people on Earth, Twitch streamers!

When Atrioc says right, we SORT RIGHT
If Ludwig says left, we SORT LEFT

4. Ask ChatGPT! If you encounter a problem, feel free to tell me, and I'll include it here!

## Setup (Mac / Linux)

Since node.js is cross platform, Stream Sort should work on these platforms, but have not been officially tested. If you manage to install this on these platforms, please tell me, and I'll update this guide!
